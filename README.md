# Portal 2016
The GBIF.org website.

## Install, build and run

### Requirements

* Node version v14.18.1 installed.
* Working gyp command line tools. On Mac that means that either xcode or the Command Line Tools needs to installed: `xcode-select --install`

### Install
Once the project is downloaded install using
`npm install`
this will install dependencies from npm and run a production build

## Run local development version
```
npm run build:locales
npm run watch:server
npm run watch:client
```
Logs end up in `user/.forever/` if nothing else is specified

### Build for production
The static assets (client css, fonts and js) is build with Gulp. NODE_ENV sets the endpoints. --prod sets the build type
```
NODE_ENV=prod node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js --prod --commit=${GIT_COMMIT}
```

### Run
Now start the server
```
npm start
//OR
NODE_ENV=prod node app.js
```
this will start the server in production mode.

## Credentials
The portal expects a json file with credentials to github repositories etc. You can point to a test github repository for testing.
The file is expected to be located at `/etc/portal16/credentials.json` alternatively the location can be defined with `gulp --credentials=your/path//and/filename`
The format is:
```
{
  "directory": {
    "appKey": "user",
    "secret": "password"
  },
  "portalFeedback": {
    "repository": "your/githubTestRepository",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password"
  },
  "suggestDataset": {
  	"repository": "your/githubTestRepository",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

### e2e tests using protractor
installation see: http://www.protractortest.org/
install protractor `npm install -g protractor`
update webdriver `webdriver-manager update`
start webdriver `webdriver-manager start`
start the server at port 3000
run the tests `protractor e2e.conf.js`

### Debugging
Debugging the server works well is Microsoft Visual Studio I find. Just attach to the process.

## Logging
Logging via [https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)

run either gulp or node with --loglevel=[terminal,debug,info,warn,error].
```
# debug to console
gulp --loglevel=terminal

# log only info, warnings and errors.
node app.js --loglevel=info
```

### Read log files
Pretty print log files

```
node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan log/warn.log.0
```

Filter file

```
node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan log/warn.log.0 -c 'this.randomAtt == "is is a warning"'
```

## Technologies

* Templating is done using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
* The server is [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* The CSS is build using the [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) precompiler and [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugins

### Image caching, cropping and resizing
We use [Thumbor](http://thumbor.org), see [image caching](./image_caching.md) for more details.

### Translations
backend done using https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node
frontend using https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate
currently the same file is shared. That only works partly since the two formats are not identical
We should probably have to files, one for backend, one for frontend and then copy values that are identical (so that translators won't have to edit two places)
It would be sensible to extend angular translate with angular-translate-interpolation-messageformat to allow easier pluralization and gender.

## Issues
Which labels to use for issues

**impact**
TODO: might be worth quantifying terms such as "rarely", "few" etc.

* low impact: used by few people that could get that information by other means. Or used rarely and not essential to usage.
* medium impact: the site can be used just fine without it, but it would improve the experience significantly. users are expected to notice on a daily basis
* high impact: The experience would improve for the majority of our users. Or something that is a nuisance to users on a daily basis.
* release blocker: Essential to site usage. Should be fixed before release

**cost**
hours, days, 3days+, week+

* hours: expected to be completed in less than a day. could be 10 minutes, could be 7 hours.
* days: less than 3 days
* 3days+: more than 3 days
weeks: more than a weeks work

**type**
bug, improvement, usability, editorial, duplicate, invalid, won't fix, infrastructure, api, cms
these should be self explanatory, but a few words on some of them

* editorial: is a content issue in the cms or translations. Content issues related to the published data doesn't belong in this project.
* infrastructure: e.g. build process, logging, firewalls etc.
* api: requires work on the api to complete the task
* cms: requires work on cms api or cms content model and interface
* usability: not a bug per se, but an improvement related to the interface and typically not in new functionality
* improvement: new functionality

### Big Thanks
This project is possible due to the many people that share their work under CC.
Attributing everyone in the interface where e.g. icons and libraries are used, isn't feasible.
