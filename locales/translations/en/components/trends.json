Since many names are not yet included in these databases, some proportion of these names will be unrecognised synonyms and do not represent valid species. Therefore these counts can be used as an indication of richness only, and do not represent true species counts. All data have been processed using the same, most recent, version of the common GBIF backbone taxonomy, and comparisons over time are therefore realistic.",
