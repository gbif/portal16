The parser is written in Java and based on regular expressions to dissect name strings into its components. It does only keep name parts required to reconstruct a full three-parted name with an optional subgenus, but ignores additional infraspecific parts such as the subspecies given for varieties. Please see our [API documentation](/developer/species#parser) for details.",
